# Chapter 2 – Design Strategy + Context DNA

**MMART 166 : User Experience and Interface**
*(Zhonghuang He – Spring 2025)*

## 1. Overview of True Research Framework

The **True Research** cycle establishes a design-thinking path from user empathy to actionable design strategy. It operates through five iterative layers:

1. **Prompt Discovery** – Identifies authentic user problems and emotional drivers.
2. **Active Learning** – Analyzes *why* those problems exist through observation and self-reflection.
3. **Iterative Research** – Validates insights using external evidence, pattern recognition, and systems thinking.
4. **Content Synthesis** – Transforms data into hypotheses and decision frameworks for real-world testing.
5. **Context DNA** – Encodes research findings into structured memory that can be integrated into AI systems for persistent contextual understanding 【34†Chapter 2.5】【35†Chapter 2.5 Example】.

Together, these layers form a *Contextual Design DNA*—a blueprint that captures user needs, emotional states, systemic barriers, and validated hypotheses before any design decisions are made.

## 2. Target Group & Focus Area

**Target Group:** Foster youth aging out of care (ages 18–25)
**Focus Area:** Transitioning to independent adulthood

This population faces unique challenges once institutional support ends. Research reveals issues of housing insecurity, financial instability, and limited emotional and informational resources during this transition【15†Chapter 2.1】【19†Chapter 2.3】.

---

## 3. Problem Discovery Highlights

### Common Problems

1. Lack of guidance for “adult paperwork.”
2. Absence of emergency support networks.
3. Missing critical identification documents.
4. No financial safety net.
5. Lack of role modeling or mentorship in adult life skills.

### Emotional Dimensions

* **Shame** – Needing to admit lack of life skills.
* **Fear** – Losing support and facing crisis alone.
* **Anger** – Resentment toward systemic unfairness.

### Contextual Patterns

Foster youth juggle unstable housing, part-time jobs, and educational commitments. Many study after midnight using public Wi-Fi, showing that timing and accessibility are critical UX factors【15†Chapter 2.1】.

---

## 4. Active Learning Insights

Applying the **5W + H** method clarified user patterns:

* **Who:** Youth without stable family or mentors.
* **What:** Struggle with bureaucracy and adult systems.
* **When:** Crises often occur outside normal service hours.
* **Where:** Transitional settings—between housing, jobs, and schools.
* **Why:** Systemic support cutoffs at age 21.
* **How:** Survival through self-created workarounds.

These findings highlight emotional stress cycles and the importance of 24/7 availability in design solutions【16†Chapter 2.2】【17†Example Answers】.

---

## 5. Iterative Research Themes

### Pattern Recognition

* **Instability cycles:** Average 7 placements per youth.
* **Digital access gaps:** 81% have smartphones, but only 37% have stable internet.
* **Emotional rhythm:** Shame → Fear → Avoidance → Crisis → Restart.

### Systems Thinking

* Housing, education, and employment systems are misaligned.
* Support drops off abruptly at age 21.
* Programs assume family or financial safety nets that don’t exist.

### Critical Analysis

* Institutional frameworks ignore emotional trauma.
* Economic fragility blocks independence.
* Information complexity discourages participation【18†Chapter 2.3】【19†Example Answers】.

## 6. Content Synthesis → Design Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis                                                                                           | Impact | Confidence | Complexity | Time   | Key Metric                      |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| 1 | **24/7 On-Demand Support System** – Judgment-free AI reduces crisis decisions by 45%.                | 9      | High       | Simple     | 2–4 wk | 45% fewer panic-driven actions  |
| 2 | **Document Navigation Assistant** – Simplifies paperwork and increases successful completion by 60%. | 8      | High       | Moderate   | 4–6 wk | 60% more applications completed |
| 3 | **Emotional Validation & Normalization** – Trauma-informed tone increases user engagement by 50%.    | 7      | Medium     | Simple     | 2–3 wk | 50% higher engagement           |
| 4 | **Peer-Validated Resource Matching** – Peer recommendations raise trust and usage by 40%.            | 7      | Medium     | Complex    | 2–3 mo | 40% increase in usage           |
| 5 | **Financial Safety Net Simulator** – Visual tool to teach consequence of financial choices.          | 6      | Medium     | Moderate   | 6–8 wk | 35% crisis reduction            |

**Top Two Hypotheses:**  1️⃣ *24/7 Support System*  and  2️⃣ *Peer-Validated Resource Matching* — chosen for their direct user impact and scalability【21†Chapter 2.4】【35†Example Answers】.

## 7. Minimum Viable Conversation (MVC) Design

**Goal:** Validate Hypothesis 1 through fast prototype (2–4 weeks).

**Structure:**

1. Greeting → Detect emotional tone (fear, shame, anger).
2. Clarification → Ask up to two guiding questions.
3. Provide practical, compassionate guidance.
4. Offer optional next steps or resources.

**Tone Example:**

> “Hey — I’m here for real-life stuff whenever you need help. What’s going on?”

**Measurement Criteria:**

* 45% reduction in crisis-driven actions.
* 40% peer validation engagement.
* ≥50% user return within 72 hours.

## 8. Context DNA Integration

**Context DNA** represents the *structured memory* of research insights, enabling teams and AI systems to retain project understanding across tools and time 【34†Chapter 2.5】.

### Foundation Layer

* **Purpose:** Empower foster youth (18–25) through conversational AI offering round-the-clock, judgment-free assistance.
* **Focus:** Address systemic disconnection between youth needs and service availability.
* **Content:** Combines quantitative data, emotional mapping, and lived experiences to shape responsive design.

### Implementation Layer

* **Minification:** Compress findings into AI-readable summaries (e.g., “Foster youth face 45% crisis reduction need after aging out”).
* **Scratchpad:** Log unvalidated observations or emerging behaviors for later analysis.
* **Export Format:** Use **Markdown** (.md) for portability, ensuring AI can interpret structure directly.

### Integration Workflow

1. Store the Context DNA in GitHub as `context-dna-v1.0.md`.
2. Paste Context DNA into ChatGPT or Claude Project Instructions for persistent understanding.
3. Create team prompt templates like:

   > “Based on our Context DNA, we know users hide their foster background due to stigma — how should the feature respond empathetically?”

## 9. Design Strategy Summary

| Design Focus        | Strategy                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Empathy Mapping** | Embed emotional validation into conversation design. |
| **Accessibility**   | Mobile-first, low-bandwidth support.                 |
| **Feedback Loops**  | Continuous data review through Scratchpad.           |
| **Ethical AI**      | Maintain privacy and emotional sensitivity.          |
| **Scalability**     | Modular rollout from crisis support → peer network.  |
| **Persistence**     | Use Context DNA to preserve institutional knowledge. |

## 10. Reflection & Next Steps

1. **Prototype:** Build 24/7 Support MVP in Figma/Dialogflow.
2. **Integrate:** Store `Context DNA` in GitHub and use in all AI collaborations.
3. **Evaluate:** Quarterly review of Scratchpad notes for iterative updates.
4. **Evolve:** Version control Context DNA to sustain knowledge through pivots.
